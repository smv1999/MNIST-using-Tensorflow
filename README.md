# Working with MNIST Dataset Using Convolutional Neural Networks

With my latest advent into the field of Machine learning and Deep Learning, I tried my hands on the MNIST dataset and gained knowledge about Convolutional Neural Networks.
## Getting Started
* Clone or download this repository as ZIP format.
* Requirements: You can install the Python packages by using this command in the Command Prompt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* After that you are good to proceed to see a demo of the application.
* Run the project using `python mnist.py` and you can see the Data Visualization in the form of graphs and `python test.py` to validate the result against a sample image.
